***This is not a diagnostic test. Please see your local health provider to be officially diagnosed***

# Instructions

As this is a test of sorts it's important that you answer each question as honestly as you can.

Before beginning the assessment, find a quiet space where you can fully concentrate on the test.

There are three sections in within this assessment. In the first section, you will be given a series of statements of which you must rank on a scale of 1 to 10.

## Section 1: On a Scale of 1-10

1. When ranking the statements, you must choose an eligible response on a scale of 1 to 10. If you input a number that is not on this scale, you will be prompted to try again.

2. Answers ranked above a 5 may prompt a new series of statements, that may not have been included previously.

3. If your responses draw concern, you will be given the suicide hotline number to call.

## Section 2: True or false

In the second section, you will be given a series of statements of which you must give a response of either True or False. You will give True if you agree with the statement and it resonates with you and False if you disagree with the statement or if does not resonate with you.

1. The only responses that will count are True or False. Anything else will be deemed ineligible and you will be prompted to give an eligible response of either True or False.

2. Once again, you may be given different answers depending on your responses.

## Section 3: Multiple choice

In the third section, you will be given a series of statements/questions of which you must choose between four options, A, B, C or D, which will be shown below the statement/question.

1. You must not input any other letter besides A, B, C, or D, as they will be considered ineligible and you will have to give a new answer.

2. You can use eiter lowercased or uppercased letters. It does not matter, as long as your response is A, B, C or D.

3. For a specific question, if your answers prompt it, you will be given a yes or no question. You will input the letter A for yes and the letter B for no.

## Score Calculation

At the end of the assessment, you will input some basic information to give the program an understanding of who you are and what might affect the results (such as age).

Consequently, if you are showing symptoms for a mental health disorder, a list of the statements you agreed with that prompted such a score, will be displayed for you to see as well as the disorder that you most likely have.

### Things to keep in mind about your score

1. Again, this is not a diagnostic exam/test. If your analysis shows concerning results, it's encouraged that you see your local health provider and get professionally tested and diagnosed.

2. It is possible to have the symptoms of multiple different disorders at once.

3. If you have any feelings of suicide, please do not hesitate to get help. You are important and there is a reason you are here. Everyone deserves a chance to get better.
